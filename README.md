# Trivia Maze

Term project for Tom Capul's TCSS 360A Software Development class at the University of Washington Tacoma.

## Description

Trivia Maze is a game where the player must make their way through a maze to the goal room. 
In order to move, the player must open doors by answering trivia questions correctly.
If the player answers the question incorrectly then the door will be locked and cannot be opened.
If the path to the goal is blocked then the game is lost.

Trivia Maze features randomized maze structure, questions, and answer order for each play session.
Game sessions can be saved and loaded.
