Cat's Paw heels, manufactured by Biltrite and first available in 1904, are instantly recognizable on vintage footwear due to their bright white no-slip rubber dots and asymmetrical semi-circles along the edges of the heels creating the Cat's Paw shape. Even more recognizable is this iconic American brand's bright red packaging for the heels that featured a black cat on the side.
